# Change log

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
* Filtering (whitelist and blacklist) of what is indexed in Search, based on Google's Common Expression Language.  See [details here](./search/README.md). Added `--search-common-action-filter-on-expr` and `--search-common-action-filter-out-expr`.
    * NOTE: This doesn't affect what is extracted from the chain, allowing you to re-index selectively without a chain replay.


### Changed
* CLI: `--search-indexer-dfuse-hooks-action-name`, `--search-live-dfuse-hooks-action-name`, `--search-forkresolver-dfuse-hooks-action-name` fused into new `--search-common-dfuse-hooks-action-name`.
* CLI: Similarly, `--search-...-mesh-publish-polling-duration` fused into new `--search-common-mesh-publish-polling-duration`.
* CLI: Similarly, all of the `--search-mesh-...` options were renamed to `--search-common-mesh-...` (previously `--search-mesh-service-version`, `--search-mesh-namespace`, `--search-mesh-store-addr`)

### Removed
* The `--search-...-indexing-restrictions-json`.  This was replaced by the filtering listed above.



## [v0.1.0-beta1] 2020-04-17

### Added
* Added `--nodeos-path` to control which `nodeos` executable is used.

### Removed
* Removed `--chain-name`, replaced by `--config-file` (or `-c`)
* Removed `init --reset` option, `dfusebox purge` does it all now.

### Changed
* Renamed `dfusebox` to `dfuse for EOSIO`
  * `dfusebox.yaml` to `dfuse.yaml`
  * `dfusebox-data` to `dfuse-data`
* `--data-dir` now defaults to `./dfusebox-data`, and is separate from a chain name or the config file location.
* `dfusebox init` now only generates a `dfusebox.yaml` config file, which can be booted with `dfusebox start`.
* `dfusebox init` now only has the interactive method. We can later add more programmatic method to boot chains.  With a `dfusebox.yaml` config now, however, we can reuse initializations multiple times.
* License changed to Apache 2.0
* Added GitHub workflow for PR checks
