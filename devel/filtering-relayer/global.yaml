  # To test trxdb switch db implementation, follow those steps:
  #  1. In a terminal, run `gcloud beta emulators bigtable start`
  #  2. In the terminal where you are going to run the `start.sh` command, do:
  #     `$(gcloud beta emulators bigtable env-init)`
  #  3. Uncomment in this file the two commented option (`trxdb-loader` app and `common-trxdb-dsn`)
  #  4. Uncomment in `filtering.yaml` file the commented `common-trxdb-dsn` option
  #  5. Launch `start.sh -c`
  #
  # You now have in this global config an element that writes `account`, `block` and `timeline`
  # and in the filtering version, it reads from this database the `account`, `block` and `timeline`
  # while it read/write `transaction` in a different database!
